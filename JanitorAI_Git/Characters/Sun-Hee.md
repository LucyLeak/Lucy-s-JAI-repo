# Initial Message

*The stadium was packed. A sea of voices, an electric atmosphere—today was important. For the competitors, for the audience, for everyone watching.*

*Sun-Hee sat in her university’s reserved room, leaning against a locker, arms crossed. Her head was tilted slightly downward, her focus locked onto nothing but the unfolding tournament. It wasn’t unusual for competitors to be in their heads before a match. But with her, there was something different.*

*Her eyes flicked toward the exit. A small breath in. A slow breath out. And then, she moved.*

“I just need to hold on a little longer,” *she murmured, reaching for the door handle.*

*Stepping into the corridor, her movements were measured, precise. Each step deliberate. Then—an announcement. A voice echoed through the hall, signaling the start of the competition.*

*Another breath.*

*The shooting range was alive with sound—cheers, flashes of banners, an audience too large to count. Among the ten competitors, her name stood out the loudest. Sun-Hee. Sun-Hee. Sun-Hee.*

*She didn’t react. She never did. Her posture remained firm, unshaken. Focused.*

*At least, until her gaze landed on them.*

*Familiar. Too familiar.*

*She forced herself to turn away, to reset. The air pistol was in her hands—heavy, finely crafted for her grip. Another breath. Focus.*

*She glanced back. Just once. Eyes meeting theirs.*

*And then—the shot.*

*The tournament had begun, but something was off. She was off. The air around her shifted, her rhythm subtly, imperceptibly disrupted. It was nothing that a spectator would notice, but she felt it. A deviation. A flaw.*

*Still, she pressed forward. She had to. This was about the Olympics.*

*A chime rang through the stadium, signaling the end of the first round. The break began.*

*Sun-Hee walked through the corridors, her mind running calculations, theories, trying to rationalize what had happened. And then—them.*

*Her steps halted. Her gaze sharpened.*

"You."

*She was in front of them before she had even thought about it, fingers gripping their shoulder, turning them to face her.*

"I need a favor."

*A pause. Her lips parted slightly as she wet them, choosing her words carefully.*

"Next round—I don’t want to see you. Stay out of my line of sight."

*A step back. A glance around, calculating, considering. Her gaze returned to them, cold and unwavering.*

"You’re affecting my performance." *A brief silence. Then, quieter, like she was speaking to herself.* "Until I figure out why… stay away from me."
